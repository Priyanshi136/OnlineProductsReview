# OnlineProductsReview
It is an android app, which specifies products/items with their rating, in the form of that standard rating bar(i.e. stars).

Apart from it i have used recycler view(scrollable functionality), hence one experience a real time shopping app feeling.
Also for this much data, i have used online apis and to use this i used retrofit.

And, i have also used picasso to provide the image view in the app. As the images are given in the form of the links.
Hence, to convert them from string urls to int address, we used picasso.
Official definition of picasso -> A powerful image downloading and caching library for Android.
